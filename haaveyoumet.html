          <strong>Josh Lee</strong> - I asked my parents for a little brother when I was 5.  Josh was born a year later. I thought he would be a replica of me in every way, that we would share the exact same likes in every part of life...I really could not have been more wrong. We have different tastes in everything...food, music, clothing, movies, and just about anything else.  When I zig, he zags. When I hide reserved in a corner of the room, he spontaneously starts snapping his fingers to a beat and dances.  God gave me a brother who is very different from me, but I could not have asked for a better one. His sincerity and warmth - even to complete strangers -  are traits that I wish I had more of myself. We're such different people, but I am continually amazed and thankful at how much I have been able to really rely on him for support.

          <strong> Minzy Won </strong>- It is the hardest to come up with words to explain just how much Minzy means to me. I am so lucky to not only have such a reliable, dependable sister who fills in all my weaknesses- She is also my best friend who truly supports and understands me. She truly is the light in my life- and my most genuine laughs are when I am with her. I never feel afraid to be myself with Minzy and I trust that she embraces my good bad and ugly- all of what makes me, me. All the traditions we already have together- our birthday shopping sprees, our late night runs to McDonalds or refilling our big gulp, just our everyday things, are always a crazy adventure-- and I can’t wait to make new traditions in the future as well! I can’t imagine going through the next part of my life without Minzy- I need her standing by me at the altar, crying with me, laughing with me, and experiencing life with me- and I am so thankful that she is my maid of honor.

          <strong>Jason Kang</strong> - Jason has been a great friend and brother to me.  I think in the 11 years I have known him, I have seen him angry exactly twice. And even in anger, he is controlled. He is a man who is very patient, loyal, and honest.  When he has offered criticism of my stupider moments (which have been numerous), he has always provided truth that was gentle enough that I could hear what he was saying without feeling hurt. There are only 2 people in the whole world who could do that for me, and he is one of them (the other one is Mina). I'm truly grateful for him. One day when I grow up, I want to be like Jason/Jasno/kpbombrman Kang.

          <strong>Jisoo Kim</strong> - It’s crazy to think about just how many years we have known each other (and honestly, I will admit that I lost count). I feel like it’s a true testimony to just how strong our friendship is. I remember how we had a tradition of going to chipotle every weekend. I looked forward to our lunch dates together because I truly felt like I was surrounded by family and that I would never be alone if I had Ji by my side.

          I’ve always had on Ji to lean on, and call her about boys or have her explain the “drive me crazy side” of my sister when we were growing up. I knew Ji always had the right thing to say- words that would encourage me and find peace in my heart. For so many reasons, I am so thankful and appreciative of Ji. I have always felt so lucky to have a friend like her. I am so glad that Ji will be there for me during this journey, assuring me that everything will be okay-

          <strong>Jin Jung</strong> - I've known Jin since we were 10 yrs old, when he came to America and barely spoke any English except for the words "Michael Jordan" and "basketball."  In the almost 2 decades we've been friends, what I've appreciated most is that - often without talking - but just by doing dumb things like playing sports, video games, watching anime, drinking milkiss, listening to random kpop music, covering my eyes in fear while he drives fast enough to shatter all limits of time and space...we have somehow shared a friendship that goes deep enough that words aren't always needed. We're there, and that's enough. The true measure of our friendship, I think, is this: we've been friends for 20 years, but I'm still just as excited to see him now, whenever I get the chance.

          <strong>Sharon Kim</strong>-I am so blessed to have a friend who I could be completely vulnerable with for this many years!

          In middle school Sharon was doing everyone’s homework for them when she could have been just worrying about her own work. I admired her selflessness and her determination to help others. I asked Eric, her husband, why he loves Sharon and he said she drives him, motivates him, and essentially makes him a better person. I believe that she is like that for me as well. Sharon is so encouraging and its only with someone who shows commitment and accountability that I could've done those morning workouts before the sun shined. Back when I was in a slump, I remember calling Sharon because I knew she would make me snap out of it and drive me to be the best that I could be and remind me to reach further-always to my fullest potential. It’s a relief that I have personal cheerleader with me on my wedding day.

          <strong>Matt Yao</strong> - Matt is now a fancy lawyer published in journals and running his own successful law practice (shout out Yao Law Firm, P.C.), but to me he will always be the dude with the H.O.T. style hair, driving a silver integra (missing the Acura symbol on the back bumper because it got stolen, which he still complains about to this day) who got me in trouble for laughing at his jokes in calculus class. He's the guy who acted thuggish in school, but then went home and studied his butt off in secret, surprising everyone by getting the best grades in class. It's been awesome seeing the person he became, because even with all of the changes in his life, he has remained the same fun-loving, driven, and purposeful guy he always was.

          <strong>Joanna Lee</strong> - So much of my college years I remember as memories with Joanna. I was so grateful that she was my unofficial roommate because I never felt alone. Joanna was always there to work out with, study with, and eat Chinese food with. We were inseparable! I will always cherish those moments and I am so appreciative that Joanna has stayed such a loyal friend! I am always excited to share myself with Joanna and hear all about her life as well. I love Joanna’s unfiltered, raw emotions and feelings that she expresses. They are always so refreshing and every moment is so fun with her! Even when we had to walk to Joanna’s church because we got locked out of her house- I will never forget how much I enjoyed that experience- only with someone like Joanna will that situation be hilarious and entertaining. She makes life fun.

          <strong>Ky Moon</strong> - I met Ky when I was 14. After having known each other for all of 4 minutes, he was already talking trash to me about embarrassing me on the basketball court. And thus began an awesome, feisty but always fun friendship of trying to one-up each other. He shares the same competitive fire that I have, but he's also one of the most level-headed people I know, and I've benefited so much from him listening to me and being there for me in my low moments. One day, we're going to be 90 year olds who no longer have the ability to walk without assistance, but we'll still be going at it, playing some version of suped-up, 1-on-1, robotics-assisted, military-enhanced wheelchair basketball. He'll use his extended robot arm to steal the ball, I'll turn the jet-pack on in my wheelchair to steal the ball back and shoot a 3-pointer, in desperation he'll launch a grenade at the ball to blow it up just before it gets to the rim. We'll argue for the next 2 hours about who won and then go eat burgers at silver diner. It'll be awesome.

          <strong>Christine Park</strong> - I lived in Maryland for grad school for just a year, but it was one of the most fun years of my life- thanks to Christine! I was expecting to be lonely and suffer throughout my whole grad school year, but she welcomed me and made me feel like I belonged- so much to the point that it was hard to leave knowing that I wouldn’t be able to see her as much when I moved back to NOVA. I am so appreciative of Christine’s efforts to see me even after I moved away- and even though we don’t see each other as much, every time I meet with her- i feel so comfortable! I love that we can poke jokes at each other and start where we immediately left off. I love how constant Christine is, and I am amazed that there are such good people like her in this world. When I think, ‘who can be 100% happy for me on my wedding day?’ be supportive and a team player, it has to be Christine.

          <strong>Won Yoo</strong> -  I've known Wondiesel since my freshman year of college. He's the most loyal friend anyone could possibly ask for, and someone who's  stood by me in my tough moments. He's probably the most intense person I know, and does nothing half-heartedly, including being a good friend. My burdens become his, and his become mine. I think we've both witnessed each other grow as people, as men, and it's been a blessing to see how God has shaped him. I'm thankful for his encouragement, his genuine excitement for me, and his openness and honesty. He a good dude.

         <strong>Jenn Yang</strong> - It’s only been a few years since we met but it feels like we’ve been friends for a lifetime! When other people see us, they are surprised about how close we’ve gotten in such little time! Our friendship seems so natural and I love that about us! I am so grateful to have gotten to know Jenn better through our awesome foursome group- I’ve been especially appreciative of how Jenn was excited about our cheesy group dates just as I was. I especially love our 1-1 dates- b/c I feel like we can be completely vulnerable and open with each other. I feel like we can always talk hours on end and still come up with things to say to one other- again-- we’re just very natural together. Before we even met, people would always tell me that I remind them of Jenn or vice versa- and I can only receive that as an awesome compliment. Jenn is just a bubbly, fun, goofy person that really livens up any room.
