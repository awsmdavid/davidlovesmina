          They say the best things in life happen when you’re least expecting it.  The night that I walked into my friend’s house for a birthday party one night in August, I wasn’t expecting to meet Mina.  It was about a month after I turned 26, so I’ll call it a late birthday present.
        </p>
        <p>
          I remember walking into Julianne’s kitchen to wish her happy birthday, and seeing Mina sitting at the dinner table with some of her friends, and I thought “Hm, she’s pretty cute.”  But being my usual shy self, I didn’t say hi or introduce myself to her right away.  It wasn’t until later in the night that we had an actual conversation together.  We talked a little about people we knew in common, a little about hobbies like snowboarding (and made plans to go skydiving together), and a little bit about our families.  I found out that, like me, she had a younger sibling who was a lot younger than she was and whom she had helped raise, that her parents were coming to depend on her more and more as she was getting older.  I thought it was really funny that we had so much in common, and also really cool that – without me having to explain – she already knew and understood some things I was currently going through myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          About a week later, I met up with her over dinner.  Originally, I just wanted to meet up for coffee, and a quick getting-to-know-you conversation.  But I guess that God had different plans.  That day I had one of the craziest, most hectic days of my still-young life.  By the end of the day I was so stressed, frustrated, and in need of food (I eat when I’m stressed) that I called her up to see if she wanted to get dinner instead.  I picked her up from her house and we went to Pei Wei, a Chinese restaurant in Fair Lakes.  I thought that we would have a short conversation and call it a night.  I wasn’t expecting to truly connect with her.  But as I said, the best things in life happen when you’re least expecting it.  We ate, and we talked for a while.  And then we went to Cold Stone for dessert, and talked some more.  And while she was sharing with me about her family, and the most important things to her, I found myself laughing again, because I couldn’t believe how much we had in common.  I told her about the important things in my life too, like my own family, the things I wanted to pursue in the future; I even shared with her how I like writing, and a very personal project that I’d been working on for the past 2 ½ years.  I didn’t want the night to end.  And by the time I started back home, I’d completely forgotten about the frustrating day that I’d had.  Meeting with her and talking to her and learning about her made up for all the other crap I’d been through to get to that point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the next couple of weeks, we hung out more and more.  What surprised me was how seemingly effortless our relationship was.  We have such different personalities, but we are so similar at the same time.  I was just getting to know her, but felt like I had somehow already known her for a long time.  Our relationship seemed to move at light speed.  We moved forward trying to be cautious, both hesitant to fall too deep too fast, but both surprised and a little scared by how natural it felt.  We were going 100 times faster than “regular” people, but somehow, it felt normal for us.  In our own awkward way, we just fit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thing about Mina is that she doesn’t just let me be myself; she absolutely demands it.  And I love that about her.  She is unabashedly, unashamedly 100% completely herself.  And she expects that of me too.  With an air of defiant cockiness covering a quiet vulnerability that is so incredibly honest and beautiful that I can’t help but reciprocate, she brings the me out of me.  She trusts me, more than I ever though another person could trust me, and that inspires me to become better for her.  It makes me realize that I have to draw closer to God, so that I can lead her in the type of relationship that she deserves; one that is ultimately glorifying to God.  She is the best part of my day.  Knowing that I’ll see her or talk to her at the end of the day makes it easier to handle everything else.  Our relationship is still young, but when I look at her, I think I can see my future, and that is terrifying and exhilarating at the same time.  I can’t wait to learn more about her and show her more of myself too.
